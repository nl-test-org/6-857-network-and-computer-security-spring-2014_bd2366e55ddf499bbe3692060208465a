Important Dates for the Project
-------------------------------

By Lecture 10 – Every student must individually post one (or more) project ideas. This is a way for students to learn about what other students are interested in and find teammates. If you have more than one idea or interest, feel free to post all of your ideas, but please use different posts with different headers. Submit a one-page project idea. Your ideas can be from the project ideas we post or they can be new ideas. Feel free to choose your teammates as you wish. We expect groups to be three or four students.

By Lecture 13 – Turn in team composition and a multi-page project draft and bibliography.

Week of Lecture 16 – During this week, each project group will meet with the TA to review their progress.

Week of Lecture 20 – During this week, each project group will again meet with the TA to review their progress.

Lectures 22-25 – Groups will present short talks on their projects in class.

Lecture 26 (last class) – Written projects are due.

Project Ideas
-------------

You should also check out the references page, in particular online proceedings from the linked conferences, for inspiration.

Another source of ideas for your final project might be Phillip Hallam-Baker's new book, [The dotCrime Manifesto](http://dotcrimemanifesto.com/).

Topics from Previous Years
--------------------------

This list has gotten a bit long over the past few years. For now, take a look at the [project pitches from 2010](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2010/pitches.html) and a list of [projects from 2009 and before](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2010/projects.html).
